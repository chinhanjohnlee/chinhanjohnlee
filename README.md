# ⚡John Lee: IT, Tech & Cybersecurity Portfolio  
*A collection of labs, hunts, and infrastructure projects from a curious mind focused on understanding how security really works.*

**I learn by doing.**

This portfolio is where I build systems, investigate behavior, harden environments, and turn complexity into clarity.  
It reflects how I think about security: calmly, structurally, and with long-term impact in mind.

---

## 🎯 What This Portfolio Represents

- Hands-on security intuition (not just theory)
- End-to-end thinking: infrastructure → identity → detection
- Clear documentation and explainable decisions
- Continuous growth through intentional projects

> *North Star:* Become a calm, trusted security advisor with deep technical credibility.

## 🏗️ Enterprise Infrastructure & Identity

### 🔹 **Enterprise Active Directory Network Infrastructure Lab**  
*Windows Server 2022 | Windows 11 | VMware*

- AD domain design with integrated DNS  
- Secure internal network segmentation  
- Domain-joined client configuration  
- Identity-focused audit and logging setup  
- Designed as a foundation for future security tooling

<!-- FUTURE:
- Hybrid identity (Entra ID)
- Identity attack simulations
-->

## 🛡️ Vulnerability Management

🔹 **[Vulnerability Management Program Implementation](https://github.com/chinhanjohnlee/vulnerabitly-management-program)**  
🔹 **[Windows 11 STIG Remediations (PowerShell))https://github.com/chinhanjohnlee/STIGs)]**  

Focus areas:
- Secure baselines and hardening
- Risk-based remediation workflows
- Practical vulnerability reduction

## 🕵️ Threat Hunting & Security Operations

🔸 **[Tor Browser Threat Hunt][(https://github.com/chinhanjohnlee/Threat-Hunt-Scenario-Tor)**  
🔸 **[Helpdesk Deception Threat Hunt](https://github.com/williamolega/Helpdesk-Deception-Threat-Hunt)**  

Focus areas:
- Behavioral detection and attacker tradecraft
- Context, sequence, and intent over single events
- Defender mindset and investigation flow
